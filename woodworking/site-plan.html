        Common wood types: poplar, red oak, white oak, walnut, maple, alder, cherry, and mahogany. 
Oaks tend to have more open wood grain meaning there will be groves on the surface where the grain is at. Maple and walnut tend to be denser woods so they will be harder to cut and stronger wood types. Poplar is light weight and is easy to dent and also is considered to be a plain and uninteresting type of wood. Alder is sometimes called the poor mans cherry since it is typically less expensive and can look a lot like cherry.
Tools and supplies: hammers, chisels, sandpaper, table saws, miter saws, jointers, planers, drill press, bandsaws, lathes, radial arm saw, wood glue, pegs, clamps, oils/finishes, and lathe tools. 
Cutting and Squaring Lumber
Radial arm saw is used to cut rough boards to smaller pieces that are slightly over sized of what is needed. The jointer is then used to flatten one surface of the board and then ran through the planer to make the two surfaces parallel and bring the board to desired thickness. The board is then used on the jointer to make one side square with the surface and then taking it to the table saw to square the final side or to cut to desired width. Drill presses are used to drill holes into the wood for different reasons.
Finish shaping
 Using a jig with the table saw you can cut one end of the board to make it squared with the surface and side. The miter saw can be used to cut the last end of the board to final length as well as making it parallel. The miter saw can also be used to cut angles into the ends of the board. The table saw with jigs can also do the same work as the miter saw of cutting angles on the ends of the board as well as on the sides of the board. Bandsaws are used to cut different shapes by hand into boards and can help to cut boards into shapes that can be sanded with sandpaper or sanding machines to create final shapes desired. Chisels are used to remove small pieces of wood and can be used to clean up edges such as a cut out and cleaning up the corners of it to make the squared. Hammers are used in many different ways such as tapping the end of the chisels to help cut through the wood or to tap wood into place and many other ways.

Gluing and Finishing
Wood glue is typically water-soluble meaning water will dissolve the glue and is used to glue pieces of wood together for different purposes. Pegs are used to help hold and align pieces of wood being glued together. Clamps are used when gluing to hold the wood together as well as apply pressure to make sure the two surfaces are touching and can glue together. Sandpaper is used to finish shaping as well as to finish sanding to higher grit sandpaper to smooth the wood and remove tool marks. There are a lot of different kinds of oils and finishes that can be used and have their own unique uses.
Wood Turning
Lathes allow wood to be turned in shaped in different ways. Lathe tools are used to cut wood while it is on the lathe and there are several different types that are used to do different things to the wood.

      <h3>Woodworking</h3>
      <p>
        Mallet
Once you have a board that has been squared you will need to use a jig on a table saw to put a taper on the board this means that one end of the surface will be smaller than the other end. You can then shape the bottom portion of the handle to the shape you want. The other board that has been squared will need to have three pieces cut from it with tapers then tape two pieces together and drill two holes on both sides going through one piece and slightly into the next piece then taping the one with holes to the third piece and drilling through the holes and partly into the third piece. Using the handle piece, it will be placed in the center of piece with holes in it and have the sides marked then they will be cut and sanded to the lines. Using pegs the three pieces will be glued together to create the head of the mallet. The handle will slide through the top of the mallet and will be wedged to fit then using a drill bit drill a large hole slightly into both sides of the head where the handle fits and then using a smaller drill bit drill the rest of the way through the head and handle and fit a peg just slightly shorter than the small hole. You can then cut plugs to fill the big hole and glue the peg, handle, and plugs in place. Sand the whole thing to finish it and then apply finish.

        Segmented Vase
Use a miter saw to cut small pieces at angles and then glue them together making rings with them. Depending on the size and design of the vase will determine the size and angle of the pieces for the rings as well as the number of rings. The ring will then be glued to a board that will be connected to a face plate that attaches to the lathe. A grove will be then cut into the ring while on the lathe creating a place for a disk of wood to fill it creating the bottom of the vase. Then the outside of the ring will but cut to create the outside dimension grove and after placing the disk in the next ring is glued on and shaped on the inside with a curved design to hold the disk in place and shape the inside and a grove on the outside is also cut to the desired size. The next ring is glued on, and the inside of the ring is shaped to match the previous ring thickness and the outside top is cut to desired shape. This is continued until all rings are glued on, then shape the outside cutting down to the grove that was cut from each ring to ring to make the shape of the vase to appear. The inside is shaved down till it reaches final thickness and the whole thing is sanded. The bottom is cut away from the scrap wood and then the bottom is finished shaped and sanded, finish is applied.
